I decided to learn python and will be swithching to python completely from ruby.Ruby on rails is limited to web development however it is considered a scripting language and well known for its elegant syntax and meta-programming.

I decided to switch to python and will completely devote myself for its general purpose in scientific computing,machine learning,artificial intelligence.I will still use ruby and rails on developing web applications and making scripts.This is a big decision but this is only a benefit for myself.

Ruby will still be my first <3.First time using the python shell/IDLE , first observation when learning python it is kinda similar to ruby , so easy to learn for first time learners.And I observe that the whitespacing is significant in python , you dont need to add spacing on each strings just add comma and the sep = " ", which makes it reliable.
