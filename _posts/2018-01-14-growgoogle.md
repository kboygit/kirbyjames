Hello it's been awhile since I posted some content in my blog site. Year 2017 was a blast it was a full of ups and downs. I started going back to school for Computer Science. I was accepted into a coding bootcamp, The Firehose Project and was so grateful that I am in the program because I learned a lot. Thanks to TechHire for the full ride scholarship.

Year 2018 a new beginning of learning, and again I was accepted into another scholarship from Google. #GrowWithGoogle Developer Challenge scholarship with Udacity 50,000 talented individuals was accepting and 10,000 of those are in the Mobile Web Track program. Now this is just an initial 3 month program out of the 9 month program to select another 1,000 individuals to proceed in the next phase for the Nanodegree program.

My aim is to be one of those 1,000 hopeful individuals to get a Nanodegree. Learning all about progressive web apps and offline first approach is a new thing for me and all about service workers. But I am grateful to learn all about this technologies. Well see each other on the second phase!
