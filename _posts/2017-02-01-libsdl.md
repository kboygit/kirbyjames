Download SDL 2.0 that is what I am gonna be using.Using the linux version has no problem working for me at all.It depends you can just use the sdl2 straight from libsdl mac version.

Source: [libsdl libraries](https://www.libsdl.org)

You need:

Dynamic & Static Libraries

But on my Mac I am using the Linux Version ~~ Search for Macports you need to google this and work your way around to download libsdl 2.0

After Installing Macports on your mac if you get an error saying command not found,make sure you set the right path for the macports.In order to resolve,type this on your terminal

    sudo vim /etc/paths

You can use any ide you want I prefer vim so I wont leave my terminal.Then add this two

    /opt/local/bin
    /opt/local/sbin

That should work , and double check if it is working.

    port version

You should see this bunch of libraries from libsdl inside SDL2 folder
