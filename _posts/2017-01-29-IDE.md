My thoughts on compiling c++ programs on Eclipse is that it takes awhile to compile compared to Codeblocks and Visual Studio Code.I am debating on what should I use for my class whether Eclipse/XCode or run a VM on windows and install Visual Studio which is much user friendly.

I am in my adjustment phase coming from a linux environment to Mac/OSX , and I notice is that mac is really awesome in terms of development workflow however there are a couple of times where I miss linux fast pace development workflow, I am still figuring out how to increase my workflow on OSX.

Therefore I conclude that there is not much a big difference between OSX and Linux in terms of development workflow. Mac is the equivalent of tesla , elegant and awesome.Linux is the equivalent of Honda , proven and tested and awesome.

Choosing between the two OS's is just a developer/engineer preference,there is not much really a difference.But you can't develop iOS App's on linux , you need a mac to develop apps for it,I think that's just it.

Just my own opinion and not trying to argue.At the end of the day , whatever os you use doesn't affect your productivity and creativity.Feel free to get in touch with me.
