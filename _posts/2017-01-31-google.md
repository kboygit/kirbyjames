In this talk, Google Software Engineer, Anthony Mays will explain the secrets to preparing for the Google software engineer interview and the story behind is trek to becoming a Googler!  
The Google Interview
What makes Google interview questions hard is this: Google interviewers aren’t just looking for an answer, they’re looking for the best answer.

Not only that—you need to be able to show why a certain answer is best (a lucky guess isn’t enough). This means you’ll need a vocabulary for talking about how efficiently a function solves a problem, and a method for deriving more efficient solutions.

The following and more will be covered:

• How to plan ahead

• What to Expect

• Interview Questions

• How to succeed

• What is Google looking for?

• Technical Preparation tips!

Brief Introduction of Anthony:

Anthony didn't think that Google would ever hire a person like him. And then, they did. Raised in Compton as an abuse victim and foster kid, he has worked as a Software Engineer at Google for the past three years and is passionate about creating a more diverse and inclusive Silicon Valley through community outreach, philanthropy, and writing. Anthony is a 2016 INROADS Trendsetter Award recipient and serves as a board member for HomeAid Orange County. You can reach Anthony on LinkedIN or via Twitter at anthonydmays.

Before the meetup I was studying on C++ ahead for school just to get prepared:

{% highlight c++ %}
//============================================================================

// Author      :

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void manipulate(double *value){
	cout << "2. Value of double in manipulate: " << value << endl;
	*value = 10;
	cout << "3. Value of double in manipulate: " << value << endl;
}

int main() {

	int nValue = 8;

	// Pointer
	// Point to int Value
	int *pnValue = &nValue;

	cout << "Int Value: " << nValue << endl;
	cout << "Pointer to int address: " << pnValue << endl;
	cout << "Int value via a pointer:  " << *pnValue << endl;

	cout << "=======================" << endl;

	double dValue = 123.4;

	cout << "1. dValue: " << dValue << endl;
	manipulate(&dValue);
	cout << "4. dValue: " << dValue << endl;

	return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}
