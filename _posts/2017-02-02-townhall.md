First TownHall engagement today by OperationCode people.Great stuff as usual you learn so much from people who are in the industry,talked about pros and cons of working remotely.

I love the community within OperationCode.So you if you ever get a chance , join our slack group and have fun and chitchat with us.It is a great community , especially to those people who wanted to learn web development,software engineering,cybersecurity,and more.It's not about what you are getting in,its about the community and the information you get.In the long run it can benefit you.

I am currently finishing my first simulation program built in c++.So I wanted to get knowledgeable on cplusplus and its libraries especially the good practices.
