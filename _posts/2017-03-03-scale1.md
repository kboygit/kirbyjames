Biggest Linux Conventon in Southern California.The Southern California Linux Expo or SCALE15x.

My first time attending Southern California Linux Expo(SCALE 15x) which is held at Pasadena Convention Center.First talk I attend is all about PostgreSQL , second one is docker swarm with hands on training , next one is kubernetes however I couldn't keep up as I didn't prepare my setup  before the event at the same time I learn something new about kubernetes container, it is similar to docker/docker swarm.Tomorrow is full packed and I am gonna be prepared before all the events that I am planning to attend to save time and hassle and learn more.The cool thing about this conference is you get to meet alot of people in the industry who works or where in a different backgrounds in the technology industry.Freebies is one of the cool stuff you are able to receive just like this shirt I got.
