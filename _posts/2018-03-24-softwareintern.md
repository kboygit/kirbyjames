I started my first day as an intern in an awesome Software Company in Torrance, CA on March 12, 2018. I was so anxious and nervous during my interview with the CEO. I am just grateful because the CEO is that cool and lenient and I know for a fact that his employees respected him not just as a CEO but as a person.

I want to grow within the company and learn as mush as I can and think positively on whatever the outcome is. The company culture is great and co-workers is awesome. I am on my second week learning our company stack Javascript on the frontend and Symfony on the backend, linux, and apache/nginx.

During my first week I learned something great that I did not know from experience senior developers. And that is one factor knowing that they are willing to help you and work with you as part of their team.

There is only one thing I can say and that is I feel welcome within the company. And thank you.
