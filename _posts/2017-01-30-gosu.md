On this day I will learn common libraries used for progamming a game in Ruby focusing on Ruby's OpenGL and SDL wrappers , I am also familiar with Ruby's gosu gem.

FXRuby is a ruby interface to the FOX toolkit , designed  for creating graphical user interfaces and which is written in C++.

So what is OpenGL?In a brief explanation OpenGL is a platform-independent API for creating graphics.

Now to install libsdl on ubuntu/debian based linux environments:

{% highlight ruby %}
sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dbg
#
Or download the SDL source code to compile and install:
# Extract the downloaded source code
tar xvf SDL-1.2.tar.gz
cd SDL-1.2
./configure
make
sudo make install
{% endhighlight %}

Will continue to research more on libsdl , since the interface rubysdl & ruby-sdl-ffi is currently outdated.It is the only extensions that libsdl supports I know of.
