Got to meet first time with my computer science cplusplus classmates and professor today.Going through ETUDES(our schools learning platform),syllabus,requirements,rules/conduct,software.Not much for our first meeting , I liked going to school meeting new people and just talk and engaged.

Got to hangout with my iranian friend who happens to be a Computer Science Major(PHP Developer).Just talk and getting to know stuff for spring semester.I got a chance to play table tennis for a very long time üëè , that was an incredible feeling and got to exercise a bit and sweat under the hoodie.

Now I am continuing to read the python book that I have.I hope I can finish the book, while studying C++.Tomorrow is gonna be another day of learning see you folks and as always! Happy Coding!.
