I was an Atom user for over two years now. Everything is smooth about the Atom
IDE and is perfect for me. For beginners, the user-friendly IDE is perfect and the package manager is great you just need to customize your own settings that suit your needs. Current updates are great however the one thing that disappoints me is that the speed of Atom, it is super slow and annoying. This breaks my heart and the love of the IDE because I had put in so much time to built my custom settings so my workflow is fast and I could be productive as possible.

Now, why I choose [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?wt.mc_id=adw-brand&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0PTXBRCGARIsAKNYfG34BNIw7Hx9k4vva8a_TpfNY_fuy8BjV7GSOeWC-Vm3Bn0v7xsJtbkaAh7zEALw_wcB) over other IDE's my simple answer it took me at least 5-7 seconds to open the VS Code IDE from my terminal. Lots of packages being built by various people and the great thing about the packages are most of them are Open Sourced. And It consumes minimal space from my processing unit.

Below is my editor settings from settings.json file. You can basically copy my settings below or customize your own.
