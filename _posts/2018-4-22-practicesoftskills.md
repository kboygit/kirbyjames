I had observed that in order for me to grow as person is to develop and practice my skills outside of technology like really good communication skills, environment adaptation, client negotiation, and able to think outside the box(initiative and commons sense).

This is the main things you need to develop as a developer and a person. If you just do pure programming and isolate yourself into the real world and what is happening around you, most likely you set yourself up for failure. Remember that in life no matter how smart you are you are still a person that needs human interaction.

There is certainly no man is an island but you need help from your peers to grow and be able to learn from them is a key to your success. And no matter what your task is take full responsibility of it and do your 100%, that shows you are a competent person and a show of respect to the people around you.

Lastly if you think you are not doing anything ask people. I myself is in doubt of asking too many questions and may irritate people but how would you know without asking question. There is no harm in asking a question unless it interferes with daily productivity and you don't want that.
