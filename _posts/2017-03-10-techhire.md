As of today March 10, 2017. I am officialy a TechHire scholar for the TheFirehoseProject online cohort immersive bootcamp.This would not happen without OperationCode and Ms.aJocelin from TechHireLA.

Shoutout to Ms.Brita from the TheFirehoseProject and TheFirehoseProject for accepting me to their program.

I am excited to start my bootcamp on Monday. I do not know what to expect after finishing the entire program.But I am hoping to learn a lot and in depth understanding of Ruby and Rails , and Javascript. Getting to know the good practices for Test Driven Development(TDD) in rails.

I wouldn't know this opportunity without OperationCode, there is so much free information given out each day whether it be about programming, cybersecurity, scholarships, etc.I started taking the prep-course of TheFirehoseProject and I finished it in two days.At first I thought I wouldn't be accepted due to several circumstances but I am determined to get this scholarship and be a scholar and also be a part of TheFirehoseProject family.At the end of the day no matter how difficult your situation maybe, if you really want it you will find a way to get it not find a way not to get it or make excuses.Here is a screenshot of my email confirmation from Ms.Brita.

With TheFirehoseProject and Tech-Hire , nothing is impossible.And I am proud to be one of their recipients.I am in school at the same time while doing the online immersive bootcamp program by TheFirehoseProject , I wanted to learn and wanted to be successful at the end. I know all of these sacrifices will eventually be paid off.

        puts "Thank you #{TechHire} and #{TheFirehoseProject}."
        puts "Lovingly: #{Kirby}"
