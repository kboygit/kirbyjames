As I started my journey to learn programming , I have no idea what are the best practices and bad practices.

I couldn't determine which is which and if what I'm doing right now is a good habit or a bad habit ,I really don't care at first I just wanted to start to program and dab my fingers on the keyboard and start typing.As I researched more the best practices


"Shotgun implies blindly scattering a million little bits of junk all over a problem, like the pellets in a shotgun shell; hopefully one little bit hits the mark. It's trying stuff until something works, rather then understanding what's going on."

Voodoo implies doing something because of magical beliefs, or more specifically, doing something for an unknown reason, especially something overly complicated: "I've always done it this way, I don't know why it works."

Neither characterization is flattering: they imply ignorance and incompetence.  


I will read this [cpp core guidlines](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) as a best practice for cplusplus as beginner/newbie.

This [best-practices reference](https://github.com/thomasdavis/best-practices) right here is kind of outdated , however there are still important point's which is still relevant up to now.I would suggest reading this stuff and keep it at the back of your mind.
