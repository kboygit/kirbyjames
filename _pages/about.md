Hi my name is Kirby you can call me Kirby.
I am mostly a self-taught developer , who loves to push 100 percent just to learn programming in general.I am a Navy Veteran who <3's technology and everything about computers.

I love object-oriented programming,data science, ruby, cybersecurity and a part of OperationCode.

I usually hangout on Github and Slack.I like to eat food which I never tried before.And love being surrounded by super motivated and like minded individuals.

Motto:

    It is better to get zero than nothing.
    If you ain't feel dying you aren't trying.

{% highlight ruby %}
puts "Hello , how are you?" + " I hope you are you doing fine and well."

class new_friend
  def highfive do
    puts "Highfive my new friend!"
  end
end

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
First Ruby Game Library Encounter:
Gem Gosu:
# Gosu's dependencies for both C++ and Ruby
sudo apt-get install build-essential libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libpango1.0-dev \
  libgl1-mesa-dev libopenal-dev libsndfile-dev
# To install Ruby - if you are using rvm or rbenv, please skip this step
  sudo apt-get install ruby-dev
# If you are using a Ruby version manager (i.e. : rvm or rbenv)
  gem install gosu
# otherwise, you can add "sudo" at the beginning of the command
  sudo gem install gosu
{% endhighlight %}
