Hi my name is Kirby you can call me by my nickname "K-BOY" .
I am a self-taught developer , who loves to push 100 percent just to learn programming in general.
I am originally from the Philippines and due to opportunities that my late grandfather had because of being a World War II Veteran and a Purple Heart recipient.
We are given a chance to live in the United States and we are so grateful for all the opportunities.

I usually hangout on Github and Operation Code slack.
To learn and being mentored by really talented people in the Technology Industry(Web Development & Software Development.), right now I am being mentored by a person whom I won't disclosed his name, mainly on Javascript.And also certain people on Ruby on Rails and different guidance and advice.
I am thankful and grateful for everybody in this journey of mine.
